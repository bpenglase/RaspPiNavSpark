The NavSpark+RTC Adapter Board for the Raspberry Pi.

[Setup Instructions on my Wiki.](http://brandon.penglase.net/index.php?title=NavSpark_GPS%2BGLONASS_Stratum-1_NTP_Time_Source_with_a_Raspberry_Pi)

I do try to rebuild the instructions every one in a while, as I rebuild my unit from scratch. I may also do a new spin of the board for the 40pin headers at some point.
